  <h3>About <i>Sally Face</i></h3>

   <p class="large-paragraph">
    <i>Sally Face</i> is a dark, psychological horror point-and-click- advernture game that was created by Steve 
     Gabry, or by his developer name Portable Moose. This game was all made with just a one-man army, so Steve
     contributed by creating the illustrations, writing, music, coding, and many more to make it all come to
     fruition.
  </p>

  <p class="large-paragraph">
    Puzzle-solving, exploring, and interacting with the game's environment and characters is crucial to
    understand the game's narrative. The game consists of five episodes. The first episode was released on
    August 16, 2016 on itch.io, then on Steam at December 15, 2016.
  </p>

   <p class="large-paragraph">
    The main character is Sal Fisher (Sally Face himself!) and his rag tag group of ghost buster friends,
     Larry Johnson (his best friend), Ashley Campbell, and Todd Morrison.
  </p>

   <p class="large-paragraph">
    Sal had moved in to Addison Apartments with his single father from New Jersey for a fresh start after his
     mother's death many years ago. This move changes Sal's life as he encounters the ghostly residents that
     still live in the Apartments and a dark cult lurking within that might have their hands on the entire town
     of Nockfell. It's up to Sal and his friends to uncover the truth from within and stop the cult's takeover.

  <p class="large-paragraph">
    At the final episode, after Sal's execution, Ashley being the last sane and living being of her friend group
    left tries her best in bringing Sal back to life through her arm. The pair storm in to the cult's main hide
    out after planting an explosive to try and save Todd who was captured and infected by the Red Eyes (the
    new physical host for the cult". They encounter Larry on the way and together they defeat the cult, but we're
    told that there will be a second game coming soon so it might not be the end for them yet!

  <h3>Why I Chose This Game</h3>

  <p class="large-paragraph">
    Sally Face is an indie game that has been near and dear to my heart back when I was in highschool when I
    was emotionally at my lowest point. This game was recommended to me by one of my friends at the time
    and it opened a whole new world for me. I was finally able to get out of my art block and started drawing
    and creating again because of this game. The story and its characters drew me in, and I just wanted to expand
    upon it with my own touch. I still love this game to this very day and might purchase the game myself other
    than just watching YouTubers once the second game is live.

  <h3><i>Sally Face</i> vs. Jacques Lacan's Mirror Stage Theory</h3>

  <p class="large-paragraph">
   Sal has a literal, physical barrier between how he is externally perceived in the world and his inner self. 
    His real and true self that is hiding all of his trauma and backstory is locked within and we the players
    discover his past bit by bit each episode, despite him being our main character and who we control the
    most. Throughout Sal's interactions with other characters, some assume his gender or whether he could
    possibly be in a gang due to his mask. His prosthetic that he received due to an early childhood accident
    shaped and curated a fundamental literal and symbolic barrier between his real, not so-real self.
